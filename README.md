# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This projectâ€™s aim is to implement a credit card approval prediction by classifying that credit card approval can be predicted correctly based on the credit score column by finding the best model whose accuracy is best which will be used for prediction. For the prediction, complex data sets have been used to check which model will perform best by calculating the accuracy of the model on the dataset using the training and testing data obtained from the dataset.
